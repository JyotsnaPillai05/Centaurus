    Gender vs Gender identity:One and the same or not?
</p>
<p>
    Gender as a term has often been conflated with sex; at times these terms have been used interchangeably. However, these are not synonymous terms. Gender, while associated with sex, is a separate aspect of an individual. It is ultimately the result of a person's relation to their society's understanding of gendered groups. Gender identity is defined as a personal and internal sense of oneself as male, female, or other. Gender expression is defined as the way in which an individual publicly expresses their gender, for example, through aspects such as clothing, hair, makeup, and body language. Gender expression can, but does not always reflect a personâ€™s gender identity. This expression can be seen on a continuum, and in most cases allows for a degree of individual variation, but this often depends on the culture and level of acceptance of gender diversity

    For example, if a person identifies as male and is most comfortable referring to his personal gender in masculine terms, then his gender identity is male. His gender role might carry the expectation to wear a particular type of clothing or behave in a particular manner. His gender expression in this instance, is masculine if he demonstrates his culture's typically male characteristics in behavior, clothing, and/or mannerisms. If he deviates from those norms, then his gender expression may be demonstrating a role that is not typically male, regardless of his gender identity. In most individuals, gender identity, gender expression, and gender role are congruous. Assessing the acquisition of this congruity, or recognizing incongruity (resulting in gender-diverse behavior), is important in the developing child.

    There are several myths surrounding gender identity. Here are a few:
</p>
<p>
Myth:Gender identity is a choice<br>
Fact:This myth suggests that individuals choose their gender identity, when in reality, it is a deeply ingrained aspect of a person's sense of self, often established at a young age and not chosen consciously.<br>
</p>
<p>
Myth:Gender identity is binary <br>
Fact:This myth assumes that gender identity is strictly limited to male or female, disregarding the experiences of individuals who identify as non-binary, genderqueer, or other gender identities beyond the binary.<br>
</p>
<p>
Myth:Gender identity is a phase or mental illness<br>
Fact: Some people mistakenly believe that gender identity is temporary or indicative of a mental disorder. However, gender identity is a valid and authentic aspect of a person's identity, and being transgender or non-binary is not a mental illness.<br>
</p>
<p>
Myth:Gender identity is the same as sexual orientation<br>
Fact: Gender identity and sexual orientation are distinct aspects of a person's identity. Gender identity refers to one's sense of self as male, female, or another gender, while sexual orientation refers to the gender(s) to which one is attracted.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Challenging these myths is essential for promoting understanding, acceptance, and respect for diverse gender identities.
