    <title>Sexuality:Myth Busters</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>
Myth: Sexuality is a choice<br>
Fact:Sexuality unlike popular opinion isn't a choice.It is innate,it isn't something you chose.Who you are attracted to isn't something you can choose,it is just who you are<br>
</p>
<p>
Myth: Sexual orientation is contagious.<br>
Fact: You are born with your sexual orientation. You cannot “catch” being straight, lesbian, gay, or bisexual.<br>
</p>
<p>
Myth: Monosexuality is more common.<br>
Reality: Monosexuality—being attracted to only one gender—tends to be the cultural assumption for most people, as it's easier to categorize someone as either gay or straight without considering that they might be somewhere in between. But actuallybisexual people make up the largest proportion of the LGB community, accounting for more than half of non-straight cisgender people.
And that number may be growing. Some recent studies show that younger people may be moving away from the idea of assumptive monosexuality, and taking on identities that are even more expansive than "bisexual" (like "pansexual" or, simply, "queer"). As Gen Z ages into the majority and older ideas die off, this myth may disappear entirely.<br>
</p>
<p>
Myth:Queer people are promiscuous<br>
Fact:This stereotype unfairly assumes that all queer individuals are inherently promiscuous or unable to maintain committed relationships, which is not true for everyone.<br>
</p>
<p>
Myth:It's a Mental Disorder<br>
Fact: In the past, being queer was considered a mental disorder, but this is not supported by modern psychological understanding.Many queer people have been subjected to heinous crimes like conversion therapy ,electrocution and had to undergo psychiatric treatment,just because it was considered to be an illness.We should understand that we can't change our sexuality,it is just who we are,it is something like your ethnicity,you are born with and you can't change regardless of whatever you do<br>
</p>
<p>
Myth:It's Only About Sex<br>
Fact: Queer sexuality is often reduced to sexual behavior, disregarding the emotional and romantic aspects of queer relationships<br>
</p>
<p>
Myth:It's a Western Phenomenon <br>
Fact:Queer identities and experiences are often seen as a product of Western culture, neglecting the existence of queer individuals across different cultures and throughout history.<br>
Queer history in India is rich and diverse, dating back thousands of years. Indian mythology and ancient texts such as the Vedas and the Kama Sutra contain references to diverse sexual and gender identities, indicating that queer identities were acknowledged and accepted in ancient Indian society.Also,The Khajuraho temples are indeed famous for their intricate sculptures, including depictions of various aspects of life, including sexuality.<br>
</p>
<p>
Myth: People who are lesbian, gay and bisexual work and live in only certain types of situations. <br>
Fact: Queer people belong to all ethnic and racial groups, are members of all religious communities, exhibit a range of mental and physical capabilities, and are of all ages<br>
</p>
<p>
Myth:The parents did something wrong <br>
Fact:Nothing you did caused your child to be gay. However, the way you respond will have a huge impact on your child's well-being.Self-blame is often the initial response of parents who learn that their child is lesbian, gay, or bisexual. This is not true. A child’s sexual orientation is not learned from anyone, including parents. Just as a parent cannot cause a child to be heterosexual, or straight, a parent cannot cause a child to be gay.<br>
</p>
<p>
Myth:A queer person is a danger to your children<br>
Fact:LGBTQ people are no more likely to molest children than anyone else.This slur is untrue. Queer people have the same protective instincts for children as heterosexuals. Sexual attraction to children is not homosexuality but Pedophilia, a psychiatric disorder.<br>
</p>
<p>
Myth:People become homosexual because they were sexually abused as children or there was a deficiency in sex-role modeling by their parents.<br>
Fact:Many anti-gay rights activists claim that homosexuality is a mental disorder caused by some psychological trauma or aberration in childhood. This argument is used to counter the common observation that no one, gay or straight, consciously chooses his or her sexual orientation. Joseph Nicolosi, aJoseph Nicolosi, a founder of the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality, said in 2009 that "if you traumatize a child in a particular way, you will create a homosexual condition." He also has repeatedly said, "Fathers, if you don't hug your sons, some other man will." A side effect of this argument is the demonization of parents of gay men and lesbians, who are led to wonder if they failed to protect a child against sexual abuse or failed as role models in some important way.No scientifically sound study has definitively linked sexual orientation or identity with parental role-modeling or childhood sexual abuse.<br>
