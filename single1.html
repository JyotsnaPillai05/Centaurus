    <p id="one" >If you have just found out that your partner has HIV, you probably have a lot of questions running through your mind. Am I infected or at risk of infection? Can we stay together and keep having sex? What about kissing or sharing food or a toothbrush? What do I need to do now to take care of myself? How can I help my partner?
        In addition to correct and consistent use of condoms, counsellors may suggest that the HIV-positive partner take antiretroviral drugs, regardless of their immune status.

        Can I Stay With My Partner and Protect Myself From HIV?<br>
Yes. Many people who are HIV positive are in long-term relationships with people who do not have HIV. Your doctors and HIV counselors can help you work through the best ways to protect yourself.
The only surefire way to prevent HIV is to not have sex or share needles. But there are many ways you can lower your risk even when your partner has the virus. Here are some tips:

Choose less risky sex. Anal sex comes with the greatest risk for transmitting HIV. It is a lot riskier when the HIV-negative partner is the one who receives.  

Vaginal sex is safer than anal sex, but still comes with risks. It is much less likely that you can pass on HIV through oral sex and even less likely with touching.  

Use condoms. It is important to use condoms the right way every time you have anal or vaginal sex. To help keep the condom from slipping or breaking, use a water-based or silicone lubricant.

Take medication. A doctor can prescribe an antiretroviral medicine to help protect you from getting HIV. They call it PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis).

        How Can You Help Someone Who Has Been Newly Diagnosed with HIV?<br>
        There are many things you can do to support a friend or loved one who has been recently diagnosed:
        Supporting Someone with HIV: Listen to their needs, learn about HIV, encourage them to start HIV treatment as soon as possible, and support medication adherence
        Listen: Being diagnosed with HIV is life-changing news. Listen to your loved one and offer your support. Be available to have open, honest conversations about HIV. Follow the lead of the person who is diagnosed with HIV. They may not want to talk about their diagnosis or may not be ready. They may want to connect with you in the same ways they did before they were diagnosed. Do things you did together before their diagnosis; talk about things you talked about before their diagnosis. Show them that you see them as the same person and that they are more than their diagnosis.
        Learn: Educate yourself about HIV: what it is, how it is and is not transmitted, how it is treated, and how people can stay healthy with HIV. Having a solid understanding of HIV is a big step forward in supporting your loved one and reassuring them that HIV is a manageable health condition.  HIV Basics pages are an excellent source of information to familiarize yourself with HIV. Have these pages available for your newly diagnosed friend if they want them. Knowledge is empowering, but keep in mind that your friend may not want the information right away.
        Encourage treatment: Some people who are recently diagnosed may find it hard to take that first step to HIV treatment. But there are great benefits to starting treatment as soon as possible after diagnosis. By getting linked to HIV medical care early, starting treatment with HIV medicine (called antiretroviral therapy or ART), adhering to medication, and staying in care, people with HIV can reduce the amount of HIV in their blood to an undetectable level—a level so low that a standard lab test can’t detect it. People with HIV who take HIV medicine exactly as prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load can stay live long and healthy lives and will not transmit HIV to their HIV-negative partners through sex. Encourage your loved one to see a doctor and start HIV treatment as soon as possible. If they do not have an HIV health care provider, you can help them find one
